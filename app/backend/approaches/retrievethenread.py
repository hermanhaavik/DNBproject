Question: 'Does my treatment medical insurance cover a CT scan in Denmark?'

Sources:
info1.txt: The insurance covers diagnostic imaging within 10 working days, for example MRI and CT scans
info2.pdf: The insurance applies to treatment in Norway, Sweden and Denmark (Scandinavia). If no expertise is available in Scandinavia, referrals can be made to other private treatment institutions in Europe with whom the company has an agreement.
info3.pdf: The insurance covers medical helpline. 
info4.pdf: The insurance does not cover treatment for illnesses, injuries, or ailments that occurred prior to the insurance's approval.

Answer: The insurance covers diagnostic imaging within 10 working days, for example MRI and CT scans [info1.txt], as long as the illness or injury occurred after the insurance's approval [info4.pdf]. The insurance applies to treatment in all ScandinaviaN countries [info2.pdf].
